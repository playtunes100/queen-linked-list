# Production
A python implementation of a multi linked list

## What is it?
A Queen linked list is a multi linked list where each node has pointers to nodes in every direction, the same way a Queen moves in chess.



## Why?
I needed a way to represent a a grid of inputs in a way that each input could link to any input around it.

A normal Array or list wouldn't have worked because it only allowed me to traverse horizontally and vertically.

I needed to also move diagonally.

e.g as used [here](https://github.com/playtunes100/connect-word.git) to represent a grid of letters.
